## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title
- Agent: Codex | Claude Code
- Scope: files/workflows affected
- Decision: what changed and why
- Verification: commands and results
- Git: branch and commit
- Delivery: pushed/merged, Lovable published or not, device updated or not, live verified or not
- Follow-up: none, or exact remaining work
```

## 2026-10-18 — Preserve staff menu availability during Manager publication

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: catalog receiver, POS device catalog refresh, staff menu availability controls, and build-enforced availability regression tests.
- Decision: existing POS menus receive catalog-only UPDATEs that omit both availability fields, so a staff pause or reopen during publication cannot be overwritten by an earlier snapshot. New rows alone receive Manager initial visibility. Missing existing targets fail instead of recreating an open menu. Staff pauses immediately invalidate the device snapshot; active order screens refresh on resume, reconnect and every 30 seconds, with explicit offline warnings and retries.
- Verification: implementation checkpoint; executable isolated Edge Function and device-cache tests added, full regression suite and production build pending.
- Git: `codex/diagnose-menu-publish-availability`; see the commit containing this entry.
- Delivery: source checkpoint only; production function/web/APK deployment and live verification pending. No production menu availability was changed during development.
- Follow-up: finish validation, publish receiver/frontend, and report device delivery separately.

## 2026-10-17 — Recover confirmed T15 QR payment from close review

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: one production POS order on business day 2026-10-16, its Bill/QR tender, saved Z-report totals, receipt number, and manager-review record
- Decision: Tony confirmed that T15's 2 salted eggs plus 3 rice soups were paid by QR; reconstruct one ฿66 paid Bill and one QR payment through the normal payment/finalization triggers, update only the affected saved Z totals, and retain the original warning as a reviewed audit record
- Verification: authoritative production reads show exactly one ฿66 Bill, exactly one ฿66 QR payment, receipt `LM20261017029`, closed order and shift, Z gross ฿11,296, net ฿11,031, QR ฿7,787, 33 Bills, late QR bucket ฿2,921 across 7 payments, and zero pending close-review records
- Git: `codex/repair-qr-tender-20261016`; see the commit containing this entry
- Delivery: guarded production data repair completed; no application code, schema, Lovable publish, or Android update was required
- Follow-up: if Manager App Daily Sales for 2026-10-16 was imported before this repair, import that POS day again so it receives the corrected totals

## 2026-10-16 — Route Side / Extra items to the kitchen printer

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: POS and customer-QR order ticket routing, Side / Extra category zone assignment, routing regression guard, and Android release
- Decision: make explicit kitchen-zone assignments override legacy name-based front-counter fallbacks and assign `➕ เครื่องเคียง / EXTRA` to Main Kitchen, so its seven side items print in the kitchen while remaining on the counter FOOD checklist
- Verification: dedicated Extra routing guard, full regression suite, production web build, Android build, production category readback, and deployed-asset inspection; physical SUNMI ticket verification remains the exact follow-up below
- Git: PR #78, merge commit `62c52dbe9dbec3dd88846097916b627e65d9c918`
- Delivery: production category mapped to Main Kitchen; Lovable deployment `31eada94-2852-489c-b5a9-0d72487894d3` published from the merge commit; Android v1.1.89 released with matching signing certificate and SHA-256 `58c6c3d530807a9d8832b69790c59af14ff017ac7eab3862d61579be57a4ae3f`; physical SUNMI ticket test remains
- Follow-up: order one Extra item on SUNMI and confirm it prints once in the kitchen and once on the counter FOOD checklist

## 2026-10-13 — Restore confirmed credit-card tender after close review

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: one production POS Bill on business day 2026-10-12, its closed-shift tender summary, and the associated manager-review record
- Decision: the ฿180 Bill and customer payment were confirmed complete, but the payment row was missing; restore one ฿180 card tender, preserve the original Bill total and paid timestamp, update only the closed shift's card-method total, and retain the original mismatch evidence as a reviewed audit record
- Verification: authoritative production reads show Bill paid ฿180, one card payment totaling ฿180, order closed, shift closed with card total ฿180, zero pending close-review records, and no existing 2026-10-12 Daily Sales import in Manager App requiring correction
- Git: `codex/repair-card-tender-20261013`; see the commit containing this entry
- Delivery: guarded production data repair completed; no application code, schema, Lovable publish, Android build, or SUNMI update was required
- Follow-up: none

## 2026-10-10 — Remove duplicate standalone crispy-pork water mimosa

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: POS menu row `b2ce3973-9102-4cbd-8417-99a8e7169f26` linked to the newly added Manager menu `defc5eb1-f513-4bb8-8db7-41ec36208c48`
- Decision: remove the separate ฿108 `ผัดกระเฉดหมูกรอบ` menu at the owner's request and retain the existing ฿69 `ผัดกระเฉดไฟแดง` menu with its two add-on groups, including crispy pork +฿39
- Verification: the removed row had zero order items, menu add-ons, menu ingredients, and emergency price changes; guarded exact-ID deletion returned one row; post-delete production and live QR-menu reads retain ฿69, its two add-on groups, and no ฿108 row
- Git: `codex/remove-crispy-water-mimosa-20261010`; see the commit containing this entry
- Delivery: production POS data updated directly; no schema, web code, Lovable publish, Android build, or SUNMI update required
- Follow-up: none

## 2026-10-09 — Emphasize the Z report sales date

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: printed Z report header and regression guard
- Decision: show the Bangkok business day as a large bilingual `SALES DATE / วันที่ขาย` value, while labeling the later timestamp explicitly as `CLOSED / ปิดกะ`, so an after-midnight close cannot be mistaken for the sales date
- Verification: dedicated Z report header guard, full regression suite, and production build
- Git: `codex/emphasize-z-business-day`; see the commit containing this entry
- Delivery: PR #72 merged; Lovable deployment `0a706489-a56e-4726-b2af-dba9ca2be3c2` published and its live print asset verified; Android v1.1.88 released as `LONMOH-POS-v1.1.88.apk`; SUNMI physical-print verification remains pending

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: SUNMI counter receipt, printable/PDF receipt, receipt regression guard, and Android release

- Git: PR #70, merge commit `340e1fcd5e6baccacb696e710c02197c929cabac`
- Delivery: merged and published to Lovable production; Android v1.1.87 released as `LONMOH-POS-v1.1.87.apk`; SUNMI physical print remains unverified
- Follow-up: print one customer receipt on SUNMI and confirm the physical layout

## 2026-10-07 — Add searchable customer receipt documents

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: receipt search page, customer and seller receipt records, counter reprint, A4 print/PDF save, navigation, database policy, and Android release
- Decision: reuse each paid Bill's immutable `LMYYYYMMDD001` number; issue only `ใบเสร็จรับเงิน / RECEIPT` while ABOUT TIME CO., LTD. is not VAT registered; lock seller details and let staff enter only customer details
- Verification: dedicated customer-receipt guard, changed-file lint, full regression suite, production web build, live `/receipts` asset inspection, Android build, and v1.1.86 manifest/asset checksum inspection
- Git: PR #68, merge commit `699f19221016d58abb7a299ed3a21113175e2270`

- Scope: GitHub Android release asset, in-app update APK discovery, missing-package feedback, and Android release
- Decision: publish POS APKs as `LONMOH-POS-vX.Y.Z.apk`; also accept exactly one non-Print-Bridge APK so a harmless upload filename mismatch cannot hide the update button
- Verification: dedicated updater regression guard, full regression suite, production web build, Android build, GitHub v1.1.85 asset name/checksum inspection, and live production asset verification
- Git: PR #66, merge commit `c602f957dfee7f4ca9ef6f80cfd03c0fa7abaacd`
- Delivery: v1.1.84 release asset repaired immediately; hardened v1.1.85 merged, Lovable production published, and Android release uploaded as `LONMOH-POS-v1.1.85.apk`

## 2026-10-06 — Use date-based receipt numbers without separators

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: paid Bill receipt-number allocation, historical receipt identifiers, Bill History example, and Android release
- Decision: use `LMYYYYMMDD001`; derive the date in Bangkok time, reset an atomic sequence to `001` each date, and omit all separators
- Verification: dedicated receipt workflow guard, full regression suite, production web build, Android build, and production database verification: 308 eligible/numbered/distinct, zero invalid formats, zero Bangkok-date mismatches, and unchanged paid-Bill total `฿136,278.00`
- Git: PR #64, merge commit `6c46e3d849a8fc7f031ce6594c68c2070499e904`

## 2026-10-06 — Add permanent receipt numbers and receipt retrieval

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: paid Bills, counter receipts, Bill History search, reprint, and email handoff
- Decision: assign one immutable `LM-########` number in PostgreSQL when a real Bill becomes paid; preserve the existing durable print path; allow all-history lookup by receipt number and prepare a complete receipt email in the device mail app
- Verification: dedicated receipt workflow guard, full regression suite, production web build, and Android build
- Git: PR #62, merge commit `7c5c5d13a495afdaac7e779496d6b49ffe07f83a`
- Delivery: production migration applied and verified for 307 paid Bills with zero duplicate/missing numbers; Lovable production published and live assets verified; Android v1.1.83 released
- Follow-up: install v1.1.83 on SUNMI and verify one new checkout, receipt-number search, reprint, and device email handoff; Thai Full Tax Invoice remains separate because it requires customer legal name/address/Tax ID and statutory invoice rules

## 2026-10-05 — Keep loyalty and payment on SUNMI only

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: customer QR menu, Crew bill requests, SUNMI checkout, legacy customer-loyalty RPC permissions, and Android release

- Git: `codex/loyalty-terminal-safety`; see the commits containing this entry
- Delivery: PR #60 merged, production RPC permissions restricted, Lovable production published and customer QR/API verified live; Android v1.1.82 released
- Follow-up: install v1.1.82 on SUNMI and verify native member lookup, point selection, and checkout on the device

## 2026-10-05 — Complete fully collected loyalty Bills safely

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: POS payment completion, customer points-member linkage, and database invariant
- Decision: complete checkout from the actual remaining balance, show the collected amount instead of zero, preserve a customer reservation when reconnecting its original member, and reject future points redemptions without a member link
- Verification: reproduced Table T10 as subtotal ฿288, points discount ฿100, QR paid ฿188, remaining ฿0 with Bill still open; dedicated regression guard and full production build passed
- Git: `codex/fix-paid-checkout-completion`; see the commits containing this entry

## 2026-10-05 — Unify member and loyalty discounts in POS reporting

- Agent: Codex
- Scope: Z close/reprint, dashboard totals, discount and gross detail, and Manager App daily-summary export
